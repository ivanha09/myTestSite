      When scaling fonts, titles need to be scaled down more than the regular text.

      Using columns might result in unexpected element sizes.
      Using different grids for various sizes can cause elements to resize differently than intended.

    message: |
      Consider including a color system with 8-10 shades of grey so you don't have to compromise.
      This also helps speed up selection by reducing the amount of greys to select from.
